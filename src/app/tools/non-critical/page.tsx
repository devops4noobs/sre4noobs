      <section className="bg-gray-800 p-6 rounded-lg shadow-lg max-w-6xl mx-auto">
        <p className="mb-4">
          The Non-Critical Issue Tracking Process provides a systematic method for the SRE team to address issues that do not rise to the level of critical incidents. It enhances transparency, fosters knowledge acquisition, and supports proactive risk mitigation by recording and evaluating irregularities, self-correcting recoveries, and concerns raised by engineering teams.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-indigo-400 mt-6 mb-4">Core Concept: Proactive Reliability</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          By systematically recording non-critical issues, this process helps prevent minor irregularities from escalating. It supports SRE best practices by emphasizing learning from small incidents and strengthening reliability, all without the need for a full incident response.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          This process also tracks recurring issues, serving as a reference for future incidents. As a result, investigations can build on prior knowledge instead of starting from scratch.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-indigo-400 mt-6 mb-4">üß† Key Principles</h2>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-6">
            <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Record all observed anomalies to keep the team informed.</li>
            <li><strong>Continuous Learning:</strong> Investigate underlying causes to reduce repeat issues.</li>
            <li><strong>Appropriate Response:</strong> Apply this process to issues that don't need urgent escalation.</li>
            <li><strong>Teamwork:</strong> Engage engineering teams for in-depth investigation as necessary.</li>
            <li><strong>Knowledge Sharing:</strong> Tag and distribute findings to enhance team expertise.</li>
            <li><strong>Streamlined Process:</strong> Use a consistent template to simplify ticket creation.</li>
        </ul>

          When to Use This Process
        </h2>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4">
            <li><strong>Detected anomaly:</strong> An error, performance issue, or irregularity is noticed through monitoring or manual checks.</li>
            <li><strong>No urgent escalation:</strong> The situation does not require a full incident response or immediate escalation.</li>
            <li><strong>Self-resolving or minor intervention:</strong> The issue resolved itself or was fixed with minimal effort.</li>
            <li><strong>Opportunity for learning:</strong> SRE review can help prevent recurrence or provide insights into underlying causes.</li>
        </ul>
